For this months Knowledge showcase,I will x-ray one of the many apps that I  made, that  can solve CTFs tasks .The name of the app is decoder.py ,its a python app that I used to solve  a given CTF task with the name REPETITIONS  at https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/371?category=5&page=1 .I have attached the file which is enc_flag and it is this file  that contains the flag .once the decoder.py is run on a VSCODE ,the app will decrypt the flag in the attached file.Both the file -enc_flag and the application -decoder.py have placed in a folder with the name CTF,Pls find the FOLDER CTF attached with this repository
